# Vue-app-with-firebase
Vue app with firebase and authentication.

During this project I learnt how to build an application with Vue CLI, and the Firebase Firestore cloud platform. I was following course from Traversy Media. I will add authentication and refactor the code and add more functionality to gain deep understanding of VUE framework.
