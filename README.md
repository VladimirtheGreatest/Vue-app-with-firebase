# Vue-app-with-firebase
Vue app with firebase and authentication.

During this project I learnt how to build an application with Vue CLI, and the Firebase Firestore cloud platform. I was following course from Traversy Media. Simple CRUD application with authentication. I will use the knowledge from this project to build my new project from the scratch.
